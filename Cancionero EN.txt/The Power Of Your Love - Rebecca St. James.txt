The Power Of Your Love
Rebecca St James
 
 C#m    B       A    F#m              G#m      C#m
Lord I come to You, let my heart be changed renewed
                   A              G#m      C#m
Flowing from the grace that I've found in You
 C#m       B        A       F#m          G#m    C#m
Lord I've come to know the weaknesses I see in me
                   A B                      E    
Will be stripped away by the power of Your love

Chorus:
F#    Ab F# C# C#/B#      C#/D# C#/E#
Hold me close,  let Your love   surround me
F#    Ab  C# C#/D#  C#/E#
Bring me near  draw me to your side.
F#       Ab    F#                    C#
And as I wait, I'll rise up like the eagle,
Ab        A Bbm F#
And I will soar with You, Your Spirit leads me on
Ab      F#   C#
In the power of Your love

The knowledge of Your love as You lives in me

Lord renew my mind as Your will unfolds my life
