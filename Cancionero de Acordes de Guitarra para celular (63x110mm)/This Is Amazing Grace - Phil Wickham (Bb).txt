This Is Amazing Grace (Bb)
Phil Wickham

Verse 1
Bb   
Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
Eb   
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger   
Gm                F                    Eb
The King of Glory, the King above all kings

Bb   
Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder   
Eb   
Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder   
Gm                F                    Eb
The King of Glory, the King above all kings   


Chorus
                  Bb   
This is amazing grace   
                   Eb   
This is unfailing love   
                         Gm   
That You would take my place   
                         F   
That You would bear my cross   
                         Bb   
You would lay down Your life   
                      Eb   
That I would be set free   
Gm   
Jesus, I sing for   
F                       Bb   
All that You've done for me

Eb   
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter

The King of Glory, the King above all kings

Who rules the nations with truth and justice

Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance

The King of Glory, the King above all kings
