Verse 1
G
Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
C
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
Em                D                    C
The King of Glory, the King above all kings

G
Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
C
Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
Em                D                    C
The King of Glory, the King above all kings


Chorus
                  G
This is amazing grace
                   C
This is unfailing love
                         Em
That You would take my place
                         D
That You would bear my cross
                         G
You would lay down Your life
                      C
That I would be set free
Em
Jesus, I sing for
D                       G
All that You've done for me

Verse 2
G
Who brings our chaos back into order
C
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
Em                D                    C
The King of Glory, the King above all kings

G
Who rules the nations with truth and justice
C
Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
Em                D                    C
The King of Glory, the King above all kings
